<h1>UR10 Robot on Fusion360</h1>

<h2>Project Description:</h2>
As part of my Manufacturing class, we work in a lab that has a UR10e robot. This is an industrial robot that has both a high payload lift and long range which makes it useful for many applications. For my lab class we are using for a range of projects including to change between various different heads appropriate for different screw types. 
I designed a UR10 robot on Fusion360 which not only made me more knowledgeable on how to navigate through the different joints in the software, but also made it easier to understand the versatility and extent of the robot's capabilities.
